## Societe:

Start-Up founded in 2017 at Drahi X-Novation Center. (start-up accelerator of Polytechnique)
The start-up is locate in Paris (75014 then 75013) and have offices at Palaiseau.
There is 10 employees mostly in the offices in Paris but the mecanical division is at Polytechnique. (Palaiseau)
The client are the airport or the airline companys but also company that want to automate inspection processes.
The company is developping an automated process to detect and locate FOD. (Foreign Object Debris) on runway, taxiway & parkings.
The current process is manual so tedious and error prone. It is also time consumming.
The solutions use computer vision to optimise this process.

## How we work:
agile dev (only sprints)
gitlab

## What i've done:
My first task was to extract specific information a stereo camera the T265.
I've also verify the mesurement from a gps in a outdoor location (l'X). (from the pixHawk sensor)
The main part of my stage is to built the IHM for the operator doing the inspection.
I've start from a greeen field and choosen the technologies used in this mission.
Built the UI and UX for the application for the airport.

The current project is written in python so i've used Django-Python to built the IHM that is built as SaaS.
For the map i've used a js library OpenLayers 6.1.1.
All the services are managed via Docker.

## What i've learn:
python
django
html/css

## What i've like:
working with real sensors
ppl working with
ppl i've met during my internship

## What was hard:
Test the code for the sensors

## What surprise me:
No CI.
No code review
No guideline for the code.
Time consume by externaling something
